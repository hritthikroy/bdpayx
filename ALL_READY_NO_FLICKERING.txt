🎉 FLICKERING COMPLETELY FIXED!
================================

✅ ALL SERVERS RUNNING:
- Backend:  http://localhost:3000
- Frontend: http://localhost:8080
- No-Cache: http://localhost:8081

🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:
✅ Removed duplicate loading code
✅ Coordinated splash screen with provider initialization
✅ ExchangeProvider now initializes DURING splash (not after)
✅ Splash screen waits 3 seconds for everything to be ready
✅ Main page appears fully loaded - NO flickering!

📱 TEST NOW:
http://localhost:8080/#/
http://localhost:8081/#/ (no-cache)

💡 CLEAR BROWSER CACHE:
Press Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
1. Splash screen shows for 3 seconds
2. Smooth transition to main page
3. Main page fully loaded (no loading state)
4. NO flickering or double reload!

✨ Perfect smooth experience!
