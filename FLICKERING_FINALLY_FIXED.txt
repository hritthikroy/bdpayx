✅ FLICKERING FINALLY FIXED - FOR REAL!
========================================

🔧 ROOT CAUSE FOUND:
The ExchangeProvider countdown timer was calling notifyListeners() 
EVERY SECOND (60 times per minute)!

This caused the entire app to rebuild every second, creating 
the flickering effect.

🎯 THE FIX:
✅ Removed notifyListeners() from countdown timer
✅ Countdown still works internally
✅ Only notifies when exchange rate actually changes
✅ No more unnecessary rebuilds!

📊 PERFORMANCE:
Before: 60 rebuilds per minute (every second)
After: Only rebuilds when rate changes (every 60 seconds)
Result: 98% reduction in rebuilds!
