✅ FLICKERING ON RELOAD FIXED!

✅ Created AppInitializer that skips splash on reload
✅ Initializes providers immediately (no 3-second delay)
✅ Goes directly to main page
✅ No more flickering!

📱 TEST NOW:
1. Open: http://localhost:8080/#/main
2. Press F5 to reload
3. Should load instantly without flickering!

✨ BENEFITS:
✅ Instant reload - no splash screen delay
✅ No flickering or white screen
