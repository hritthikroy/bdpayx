🎉 YOUR FLUTTER APP IS OPEN IN CHROME!

Flutter automatically opened a Chrome window when it started.
Look for a Chrome window that opened automatically.

---

⚠️  IMPORTANT:

You're seeing the "Build Required" message because:
1. Flutter opened its OWN Chrome window automatically
2. You're trying to access http://localhost:8080 in a DIFFERENT browser/tab
3. The serve-app-fixed.js server is showing that message

---

✅ SOLUTION:

Look for the Chrome window that Flutter opened automatically!
It should show your BDPayX app with:
• Splash screen
• Login/Register screens
• Home screen with exchange calculator
• All your features

---

🔍 CAN'T FIND THE CHROME WINDOW?

Option 1: Check your open windows
Look for a Chrome window that opened when Flutter started

Option 2: Check Flutter terminal
The terminal shows: "Flutter run key commands"
This means it's running!

Option 3: Restart Flutter to open Chrome again
Press 'q' in the Flutter terminal
Then run: flutter run -d chrome --web-port=8080

---

📱 WHAT'S RUNNING:

✅ Backend API:     http://localhost:3000
✅ Admin Dashboard: http://localhost:8081/login.html
✅ Flutter App:     Running in Chrome (auto-opened window)

---

🎯 TO USE YOUR FLUTTER APP:

1. Find the Chrome window Flutter opened
2. Or press 'R' in Flutter terminal to restart
3. Or close Flutter (press 'q') and restart

---

💡 TIP:

Flutter doesn't work like a regular web server.
It opens its own Chrome window with hot reload.
Don't try to access it from another browser tab!

---

✅ YOUR APP IS RUNNING!

Just find the Chrome window that Flutter opened automatically.
